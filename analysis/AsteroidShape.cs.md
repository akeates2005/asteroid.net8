## Analysis: AsteroidShape

### Overview
The `AsteroidShape.cs` file defines a class responsible for generating the procedural polygonal shapes of asteroids. Its purpose is to create visual variety by generating randomized vertices around a central point, resulting in natural-looking, non-uniform asteroid outlines.

### Entry Points
- `AsteroidShape(int numPoints, float radius, Random random)`: The constructor is the sole entry point. It is called by the `Asteroid` class constructor to generate the shape for a new asteroid.

### Core Implementation

#### 1. Properties (`AsteroidShape.cs:10`)
- `Points`: A `Vector2[]` array that stores the vertices of the generated polygonal shape. This is the primary output of the class.

#### 2. Shape Generation (`AsteroidShape.cs:15-25`)
- The constructor takes the number of points, a base radius, and a `Random` object as input.
- It initializes the `Points` array (`:17`).
- It loops from `i = 0` to `numPoints - 1` (`:18`).
- Inside the loop:
    - It calculates an `angle` for the vertex, distributing the points evenly around a circle (`:20`).
    - It calculates a `randomRadius` by taking the base `radius` and adding a small random value (`random.NextDouble() * 10 - 5`), which creates the jagged, irregular appearance (`:21`).
    - It calculates the `(x, y)` coordinates for the vertex using `MathF.Cos(angle)` and `MathF.Sin(angle)` multiplied by the `randomRadius`, and stores it in the `Points` array (`:22`).

### Data Flow
1.  The `Asteroid` constructor calls the `AsteroidShape` constructor, passing in the desired number of vertices, the asteroid's base radius, and a `Random` instance.
2.  The `AsteroidShape` constructor generates a set of `Vector2` points and stores them in its public `Points` property.
3.  The `Asteroid` object then holds onto this `AsteroidShape` instance.
4.  When the `Asteroid.Draw()` method is called, it accesses the `_shape.Points` array to get the vertices needed to draw the asteroid's outline.

### Key Patterns
- **Procedural Generation:** This class is a clear example of procedural content generation. It uses an algorithm with random elements to create unique data (the asteroid's shape) at runtime.
- **Builder Pattern (Simplified):** The class can be seen as a simple builder. It is constructed with the necessary parameters and, upon construction, "builds" the array of points which is then retrieved by the client (the `Asteroid` class).

### Configuration
- The number of vertices (`numPoints`) and the base `radius` are configured by the calling `Asteroid` object.
- The degree of randomness in the shape is determined by the hardcoded range `* 10 - 5` (`:21`).

### Error Handling
- This class contains no explicit error handling. It assumes the `random` object is not null and that `numPoints` is a non-negative integer.
