## Analysis: AsteroidSize

### Overview
`AsteroidSize.cs` is a simple enumeration that defines the different size categories for asteroids in the game. This enum is used throughout the codebase to control asteroid behavior, scoring, and visual representation.

### Core Implementation
- The file defines a public `enum` named `AsteroidSize` (`:5`).
- It contains three members:
    - `Small` (`:9`)
    - `Medium` (`:14`)
    - `Large` (`:19`)
- Each member has a summary comment explaining its characteristics (radius, movement, point value).

### Data Flow
- The `AsteroidSize` enum is used as a parameter in the `Asteroid` constructor (`Asteroid.cs:40`) to determine the new asteroid's properties.
- It is checked in the `Asteroid` constructor to set the `Radius` (`Asteroid.cs:48`).
- It is used in `GameEnhancements.SplitAsteroid` (`GameEnhancements.cs:13`) to determine if an asteroid should split and what size the new pieces should be.
- It is used in `GameEnhancements.CalculateAsteroidScore` (`GameEnhancements.cs:91`) to determine the base score value.
- It is used by `AdvancedEffectsManager.OnAsteroidDestroyed` (`AdvancedEffectsManager.cs:382`) to scale the explosion effect size.

### Key Patterns
- **Enum:** This is a straightforward use of an enumeration to create a set of named constants for representing the different sizes of asteroids. This improves code readability and maintainability compared to using magic numbers.

### Configuration
- The available sizes are hardcoded as enum members. Adding a new asteroid size would require modifying this file and updating the `switch` statements that use it.

### Error Handling
- As a simple enum definition, there is no error handling involved.
