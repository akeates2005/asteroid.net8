The optimal consolidation strategy would combine the performance advantages of SimpleProgram's specialized systems with the maintainability of EnhancedSimpleProgram's service-oriented architecture.

Key consolidation challenges:
1. **Object Pooling**: Architectural paradigm differences
2. **Visual Effects**: Feature complexity vs. maintainability
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time vs. batch processing
4. **System Integration**: Composition vs. service orientation

The migration complexity is **Medium-to-High** due to fundamental architectural differences, but the potential benefits include improved performance, better maintainability, and enhanced feature sets.
