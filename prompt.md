I'm looking to implement full 3D support into the Asteroids game based on the foundations already in place. Review the current codebase and the initial plan in ./plans and revise the test driven implementation that so I can validate that it will deliver full functionality with no mocks or shortcuts or major disruption to the existing codebase. This needs to actually work, think hard, and focus. And document the full implementation plan in ./plans (phases 1 -5 following SPARC) using a 5 agent swarm to implement later. don't build just document.
