# Asteroids: Recharged Edition

A modern, high-performance implementation of the classic Asteroids game built with C# and Raylib, featuring advanced enhancements including object pooling, audio management, and proven GameProgram architecture.

## ⚠️ Recent Changes (Latest Update)

**Architecture Reversion**: Successfully reverted from ModularGameEngine back to the proven **GameProgram** implementation due to functionality issues with the modular approach. The current version now uses the stable, fully-functional GameProgram with all original features restored.

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed bullet physics bug (velocity calculation corrected)
- ✅ Restored collision detection functionality 
- ✅ Verified pause and fire controls working
- ✅ All original UI and audio features operational
- ✅ ModularGameEngine safely archived for future reference

## 🚀 Features

### Core Gameplay

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Dynamic scaling with level progression
- **Shield System**: Temporary protection with cooldown mechanics  
- **Persistent Leaderboard**: Local high score tracking with JSON persistence
- **Pause & Resume**: Full game state management with P key
- **Level Progression**: Ship automatically centers between levels

### Advanced Enhancements
- **Object Pooling System**: Memory-efficient bullet and particle management
- **Audio Management**: Comprehensive sound system with volume controls and settings
