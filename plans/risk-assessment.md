## Critical Risks (Score: 8-9)

### R001: Performance Regression in 3D Mode
**Risk Score: 9 (High Impact × High Probability)**

**Description**: 3D rendering enhancements may cause significant performance degradation, failing to meet the 60+ FPS target on target hardware.

**Impact Analysis**:
- User experience severely compromised
- Negative reviews and user abandonment
- Project objectives not met
- Potential rollback required

**Root Causes**:
- Inefficient 3D rendering pipeline implementation
- Memory leaks in mesh generation or caching
- Excessive draw calls or poor batching
- Inadequate LOD (Level of Detail) implementation
- Poor frustum culling or overdraw

**Early Warning Indicators**:
- Frame time consistently >16.7ms during development testing
- Memory usage growing beyond 70MB threshold
- High CPU/GPU utilization during benchmarking
- Increasing draw call count without proportional quality gains

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Primary Mitigation**:
1. **Aggressive Performance Testing**
   - Implement continuous performance benchmarking in CI/CD
   - Set strict performance gates (fail build if <50 FPS)
   - Daily performance regression testing
   - Real-time profiling during development

2. **Performance-First Architecture**
   - Implement LOD system with at least 3 detail levels
   - Use frustum culling to eliminate non-visible objects
   - Implement object batching for similar meshes
   - Cache frequently used meshes with LRU eviction

3. **Dynamic Quality Adjustment**
   ```csharp
   public class DynamicQualityManager
   {
       public void AdjustQuality(PerformanceMetrics metrics)
       {
           if (metrics.AverageFrameRate < 50.0f)
           {
               ReduceVisualQuality();
               IncreaseLODLevel();
               DisableNonEssentialEffects();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Level 1**: Reduce default quality settings
- **Level 2**: Disable advanced visual effects
- **Level 3**: Force LOD level increase
- **Level 4**: Emergency fallback to 2D mode

**Monitoring and Control**:
- Real-time frame rate monitoring
- Memory usage alerts at 50MB threshold
- Automated performance regression detection
- User telemetry for performance metrics

- Extended development timeline
- Increased technical debt
- Regression in stable features

**Root Causes**:
- Tight coupling between existing components
- Insufficient abstraction layers
- Breaking changes to core interfaces
- Complex state management between 2D/3D modes

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Primary Mitigation**:
1. **Phased Integration Approach**
   ```csharp
   public class IntegrationPhaseManager
   {
       public async Task ExecutePhase(IntegrationPhase phase)
       {
           var rollbackPoint = CreateRollbackPoint();
           try
           {
               await phase.Execute();
               await ValidateIntegration();
           }
           catch (IntegrationException ex)
           {
               await RollbackToPoint(rollbackPoint);
               throw;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Interface Segregation**
   - Maintain strict separation between 2D and 3D renderers
   - Use factory pattern for renderer creation
   - Implement adapter pattern for legacy compatibility

3. **Comprehensive Regression Testing**
   - 100% test coverage for integration points
   - Automated backward compatibility testing
   - Visual regression testing for 2D mode

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Level 1**: Rollback individual integration phase
- **Level 2**: Disable 3D features, maintain 2D functionality
- **Level 3**: Complete project rollback with hotfix

               ApplyLinuxOptimizations();
           else if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX))
               ApplyMacOSOptimizations();
       }
   }
   ```
