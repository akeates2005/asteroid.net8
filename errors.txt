âœ… COMPREHENSIVE PARTICLE CLEARING SYSTEM - Found and Fixed ALL Missing Systems

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
The nuclear clearing was failing because we had MULTIPLE separate particle systems that weren't being cleared:

### ðŸŽ¯ All Particle Systems Now Cleared:

1. **_explosions List** (EnhancedSimpleProgram) âœ…
   - Standard explosion particles list
   - Now: explosions.Clear()

2. **PoolManager Particles** (PoolManager) âœ…  
   - Pooled bullets and explosion particles
   - Now: poolManager.ClearAllPools()

3. **VisualEffectsManager Particles** (VisualEffectsManager) âœ… **[MISSING PIECE #1]**
   - Trail particles, screen effects, flash effects
   - Now: visualEffects.ClearAllEffects() 

4. **Player Engine Particles** (Player) âœ… **[MISSING PIECE #2]**
   - Player thrust trail particles
   - Now: player.ClearEngineParticles()

### ðŸ”§ Comprehensive Clearing Implementation:

**ClearAllParticles() now clears:**
- Explosion particles list (_explosions)
- Pool manager particles (bullets + pooled particles)
- Visual effects particles (trails, screen effects)
- Player engine particles (thrust trails)
- Forces garbage collection
- Comprehensive logging for verification

**Triggered at:**
- Level transitions (StartLevel)
- Game resets (ResetGame)  
- Player death/collision
- With detailed logging to verify clearing

### ðŸš€ Previous Systems Still Active:
- Ultra-short particle lifespans (0.08-0.25 seconds)
- Strict visibility thresholds (Lifespan > 2.0f)
- Early deactivation triggers
- Delta-time consistent timing

## RESULT:
All 4+ particle systems are now identified and cleared at every level transition. No more persistent dots across levels!
